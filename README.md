# 🩺 Integrated Disease Surveillance & Predictive Vaccination Strategy

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **Integrated Disease Surveillance & Predictive Vaccination Strategy** is an end-to-end **Data Science and Machine Learning project** built for **district-level public health planning** in India.  

It transforms raw, scattered health data into **real-time, predictive, and actionable insights** for **Government health officials**, **district collectors**, and **block-level health officers** — enabling them to **identify disease hotspots, forecast risks, and plan vaccinations proactively**.

---

## 🎯 **Project Motivation**

India faces frequent **localized outbreaks** (e.g., Dengue, Malaria, seasonal flu) which often escalate due to **slow detection**, **manual data handling**, and **reactive vaccination drives**.  

This project shows how **modern Data Science + ML** can:  
✅ Combine multiple real-world datasets (Outbreaks, Population, Vaccination, Weather)  
✅ Find patterns hidden in millions of rows  
✅ Forecast next month’s high-risk districts  
✅ Automate insights for **faster & smarter decision-making**

---

## 🔍 **Key Goals**

1. **Combine Data:** Merge health, vaccination, population, and weather data at the **district level**.
2. **Find Insights:** Use **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** & **advanced stats tests** to detect patterns.
3. **Predict Risk:** Build ML models to classify **high vs low risk** districts.
4. **Plan Vaccination:** Show clear **priority areas** for vaccination campaigns.
5. **Enable Action:** Deliver ready-to-use **dashboards, reports, and CSVs** for health officers.

## 🧮 **What Methods Are Used**

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Weekly outbreak trends across 52 weeks
- Seasonal patterns & district-level hotspots
- Outlier detection
- Correlation of outbreaks with weather (Rainfall, Humidity)

✅ **Advanced Statistical Tests**  
- **T-Test:** Compare means across groups  
- **ANOVA:** Check for significant differences  
- **Chi-Square Test:** Check relationships between categorical variables

✅ **Machine Learning Models**  
- **Logistic Regression:** Basic classifier for High vs Low risk
- **Random Forest:** Improved accuracy, ranks top drivers of risk
- **Prophet Model:** Predicts 4-week ahead outbreak trends for each district

✅ **Actionable Deliverables**  
- Power BI Dashboard: Monitoring, Drivers, Actions
- Excel Pivot Sheets: 4 views for offline slicing
- Weekly Risk Forecast CSV: Directly usable
